I'm a first year graduate student from [School of informatics](https://informatics.xmu.edu.cn/), [Xiamen University](https://www.xmu.edu.cn/). My research interest includes machine learning, one dimensional signal processing.

I am very fortunate to be a student of Dr.[Xiaotong Tu](https://tormii.github.io/ ) from [Smartdsp Lab](https://xmu-smartdsp.github.io/).
